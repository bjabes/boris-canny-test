        <h1>Sample Census Custom API Endpoints</h1>
        <p>You should have the following integration endpoints available on this server.</p>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Name</th>
                    <th>Description</th>
                    <th>Endpoint URL</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>minimal</td>
                    <td>An endpoint that stubs every method but doesn't push data</td>
                    <td>{{ site.environment.URL }}/.netlify/functions/minimal</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>canny</td>
                    <td>A basic integration with canny.io that upserts users</td>
                    <td>{{ site.environment.URL }}/.netlify/functions/canny</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>postgres</td>
                    <td>A basic integration that can write into PostgreSQL databases</td>
                    <td>{{ site.environment.URL }}/.netlify/functions/postgres</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <h2>Installation & Testing Instructions</h2>
        <p>These functions are currently deployed and waiting to be connected in Census</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Login to Census at <a href="//app.getcensus.com">app.getcensus.com</a></li>
            <li>Click on the <strong>Connections</strong> tab</li>
            <li>Click on <strong>Add Service</strong> and select <strong>Custom API</strong></li>
            <li>Paste the appropriate endpoint URL of the custom API</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Notes for PostgreSQL Connection</h2>
        <p>The code for a custom connector doesn't embed any credentials for accessing your
           destination database. There's a few ways to provide these credentials when building
           your own connectors (see our docs). In this basic setup, you should add credentials
           to the environment using Netlify's
           <a href="https://app.netlify.com/sites/{{ site.environment.SITE_NAME }}/settings/deploys#environment">site settings</a>
        </p>
        <h2>How to Debug</h2>
        <p>The folks at Netlify provide an easy way to access the log of how lambda functions execute. For example,
           <a href="https://app.netlify.com/sites/{{ site.environment.SITE_NAME }}/functions/minimal">this page</a>
           shows the log for the minimal endpoint.
